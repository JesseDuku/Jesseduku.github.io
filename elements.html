									Hello!ðŸ‘‹ I am Blessing Agyei Kyem, a Final Year Civil Engineering Student in
									<a style='color:#4c00ff' href="https://www.knust.edu.gh/">Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology</a>
									in Ghana. I have a strong passion for A.I/Machine learning and researches more on how to apply A.I to solve problems in and outside 
									Civil engineering. I enjoy coding and also teaching people how to code. Being a Co-founder of <a style="color:#4c00ff" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/bitlabsgh/">BITLabs</a>, 
									an organization which teaches kids how to code, I have been able to teach Grade 4, Grade 5, Grade 6 students how to program in <a style="color:#4c00ff" href="https://www.python.org/">python</a> for them to build
									their own games. 
								</p>

								<p>
									I have a strong background in Mathematics especially in the field of Linear Algebra, Multivariate Calculus, Differential Equations , Probability and Statistics. 
								</p>

								<p>
									As a self-taught programmer and Machine learning Engineer, I believe with the right mindset, motivation, discipline, consistency, and <br>
									hardwork, no matter how daunting a task or a goal is, one would be able to achieve it. <br>
									My decisive moment to start learning about programming, data and exploring more into A.I began when I read an article by <a style='color:#4c00ff' href="https://hbr.org/">Havard <br>
									Business Review</a>  titled  <a style='color:#4c00ff' href="https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century"><i>Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century</i> </a>.
								</p>

								<p>
									With the life-changing inspiration and high-level insight i drew from the article, I immediately started learning about python programming. <br>
									The journey was tough as it was my first time learning programming. Nonetheless, I didn't give up because I had the passion to learn and <br>
									really enjoyed the coding experience. After some months of hardwork, I became familiar and comfortable with python programming.<br> 
									I rememeber my first beginner project where I built a Library Management System using functional programming which was really an <br>
									an interesting experience. 
								</p>

								<p>
									I began learning and taking some courses relating to Data Science/machine learning, enrolled for an online bootcamp and worked on a <br>
									couple of data science projects. A friend called <a style='color:#4c00ff' href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennis-frimpong-46a67791/">Dennis Frimpong</a> who is currently a Computer Science Student at <a style='color:#4c00ff' href="https://www.kenyon.edu/">Kenyon College</a> brought <br>
									an idea of an A.I startup now called <a style='color:#4c00ff' href="https://bismuthinc.com/">Bismuth Technologies</a> where we worked together to bring it into fruition. I had the opportunity to work <br>
									as a Beginner Data Scientist. 
								</p>

								<p>
									Currently, my research focuses on applying A.I to solve problems in the field of Transportation engineering, building Computer Vision<br>
									algorithms to recognize abnormal events or behaviors in transportation systems and develop advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). <br>
									For example, detection of accidents, traffic violations, or pedestrians crossing at unauthorized locations.  <br>
