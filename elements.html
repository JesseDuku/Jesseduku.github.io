                    Hello!ðŸ‘‹ I am Jesse Duku, a passionate civil engineer and researcher leveraging data science and modeling techniques to analyze complex environmental systems.
                    <a href="https://www.knust.edu.gh/" style="color: #4c00ff">I hold a bachelor's degree in civil engineering from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in Ghana, where I graduated among the top of my class.</a>
                    As an undergraduate, I developed strong proficiency in environmental engineering concepts and quantitative analysis through coursework and research projects. My senior thesis harnessed machine learning algorithms to model structural behavior, sharpening my skills in statistical modeling and computation. I further honed these abilities during my role as a research assistant at the Regional Water and Environmental Sanitation Center in Ghana.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Beyond my technical work, I am the Founder and President of the Civil AI Club, an organization providing hands-on AI training for civil engineering students. Through this leadership experience, I have gained skills in education, team management, and program development.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My goal is to pursue impactful research elucidating the interconnected dynamics of climate, hydrology, and ecology. I am particularly passionate about topics such as drought analysis, flood modeling, coastal hydraulics, and sustainable water resource management. I believe my background in data-driven methods and environmental systems equips me well to pursue graduate studies and an academic career in a field like hydrology or water resources engineering.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am excited to collaborate across disciplines to analyze pressing environmental challenges. As a student from Ghana, I also hope to one day apply the expertise from my graduate training to strengthen research and teaching capacity in my home region. Overall, I am committed to conducting solution-driven work that advances scientific understanding and informs policies for resilience and sustainability.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Currently, my research focuses on applying A.I to solve problems in the field of hydrosystems engineering and building Computer Vision algorithms.
                </p>
