									Hello!ðŸ‘‹ I am Jesse Duku, a passionate civil engineer and researcher leveraging data science and modeling techniques to analyze complex environmental systems.
									<a style='color:#4c00ff' href="https://www.knust.edu.gh/"> I hold a bachelor's degree in civil engineering from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in Ghana, where I graduated among the top of my class.</a>
									As an undergraduate, I developed strong proficiency in environmental engineering concepts and quantitative analysis through coursework and research projects. My senior thesis harnessed machine learning algorithms to model structural behavior, sharpening my skills in statistical modeling and computation. I further honed these abilities during my role as a research assistant at the Regional Water and Environmental Sanitation Center in Ghana.
								</p>

								<p>
									I have a strong background in Mathematics especially in the field of Linear Algebra, Multivariate Calculus, Differential Equations , Probability and Statistics. 
								</p>

								<p>
									As a self-taught programmer and Machine learning Engineer, I believe with the right mindset, motivation, discipline, consistency, and <br>
									hardwork, no matter how daunting a task or a goal is, one would be able to achieve it. <br>
									My decisive moment to start learning about programming, data and exploring more into A.I began when I read an article by <a style='color:#4c00ff' href="https://hbr.org/">Havard <br>
									Business Review</a>  titled  <a style='color:#4c00ff' href="https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century"><i>Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century</i> </a>.
								</p>

								<p>
									With the life-changing inspiration and high-level insight i drew from the article, I immediately started learning about python programming. <br>
									The journey was tough as it was my first time learning programming. Nonetheless, I didn't give up because I had the passion to learn and <br>
									really enjoyed the coding experience. After some months of hardwork, I became familiar and comfortable with python programming.<br> 
									I rememeber my first beginner project where I built a Library Management System using functional programming which was really an <br>
									an interesting experience. 
								</p>

								<p>
									I began learning and taking some courses relating to Data Science/machine learning, enrolled for an online bootcamp and worked on a <br>
									couple of data science projects. A friend called <a style='color:#4c00ff' href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennis-frimpong-46a67791/">Dennis Frimpong</a> who is currently a Computer Science Student at <a style='color:#4c00ff' href="https://www.kenyon.edu/">Kenyon College</a> brought <br>
									an idea of an A.I startup now called <a style='color:#4c00ff' href="https://bismuthinc.com/">Bismuth Technologies</a> where we worked together to bring it into fruition. I had the opportunity to work <br>
									as a Beginner Data Scientist. 
								</p>

								<p>
									Currently, my research focuses on applying A.I to solve problems in the field of Transportation engineering, building Computer Vision<br>
									algorithms to recognize abnormal events or behaviors in transportation systems and develop advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). <br>
									For example, detection of accidents, traffic violations, or pedestrians crossing at unauthorized locations.  <br>
