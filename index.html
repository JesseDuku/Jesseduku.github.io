    <!-- About Section -->
    <section id="about" class="container">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
        Jesse Duku is passionately devoted to the field of water resource engineering, with a special focus on hydrologic extremes and compound hazards.
    </p>
    <p>
        His research centers around the study of extreme hydrologic events, such as floods and droughts, which are becoming more prevalent due to the impacts of climate variability. Jesse aims to develop strategies that not only enhance community resilience but also minimize the adverse effects these events have on both marginal population and the environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jesse is also deeply interested in compound hazards, which involve the interplay of multiple risk factors occurring simultaneously. By investigating these complex scenarios, he seeks to improve our ability to predict and mitigate the combined effects of such events.
    </p>
    <p>
        A significant portion of his work involves the use of advanced statistical and hydrological models. These models are crucial for predicting water availability, assessing risks, and designing robust infrastructure capable of adapting to environmental changes. Jesseâ€™s expertise in these areas significantly contributes to the advancement of sustainable water management practices.
    </p>
    <p>
        With a strong background in data analysis and a keen interest in innovation, Jesse is exploring the potential of machine learning and artificial intelligence to transform water resource management. He believes that these technologies can lead to the development of sophisticated solutions that can adapt dynamically to environmental shifts.
